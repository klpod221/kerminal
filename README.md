## üõ†Ô∏è Development

### Project Structure

- **Frontend**: Vue 3 with Composition API, Pinia stores, TypeScript
- **Backend**: Rust with Tauri v2, async/await with Tokio
- **Terminal**: xterm.js with WebGL renderer and addons
- **SSH**: russh library for SSH protocol implementation
- **Database**: SQLx for SQL databases, MongoDB driver for NoSQL
- **Encryption**: AES-GCM with Argon2 key derivation

### Key Technologies

| Layer | Technology | Purpose |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| Frontend | Vue 3 + TypeScript | Reactive UI framework |
| State | Pinia | Centralized state management |
| Backend | Rust + Tauri v2 | Native performance and security |
| SSH | russh | SSH protocol implementation |
| Terminal | xterm.js | Terminal emulation |
| Database | SQLite, MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB | Local and sync storage |
| Encryption | AES-256-GCM + Argon2 | Data encryption and key derivation |

### Code Quality

```bash
# Format code
npm run pretty

# Type checking
npm run build

# Full development build
npm run tauri dev
```

### Design Patterns

- **Dependency Injection**: Backend services use Arc<Mutex<T>> pattern
- **Service Layer**: Clean separation between UI, business logic, and data access
- **State Management**: Centralized Pinia stores with computed properties
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive try/catch with user-friendly messages

## üìä Performance

- **Efficient Buffer Management**: Circular buffer for terminal history with memory limits
- **Connection Pooling**: Reuse SSH connections for better performance
- **Lazy Loading**: Components and data loaded on demand
- **Optimized Rendering**: WebGL-accelerated terminal with efficient updates
- **Background Processing**: Async operations don't block UI

## üîí Security Considerations

- All sensitive data encrypted at rest with AES-256-GCM
- Master password never stored, only verification hash
- Device-specific encryption keys prevent data access from other devices
- SSH private keys never leave the device unencrypted
- Sync data encrypted before transmission
- Automatic session locking after inactivity
- Platform keychain integration for secure auto-unlock
