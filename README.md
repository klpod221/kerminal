## 🛠️ Development

### Project Structure

- **Frontend**: Vue 3 with Composition API, Pinia stores, TypeScript
- **Backend**: Rust with Tauri v2, async/await with Tokio
- **Terminal**: xterm.js with WebGL renderer and addons
- **Recording**: asciicast v2 format with asciinema-player for playback
- **SSH**: russh library for SSH protocol implementation
- **Database**: SQLx for SQL databases, MongoDB driver for NoSQL
- **Encryption**: AES-GCM with Argon2 key derivation

### Key Technologies

| Layer | Technology | Purpose |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| Frontend | Vue 3 + TypeScript | Reactive UI framework |
| State | Pinia | Centralized state management |
| Backend | Rust + Tauri v2 | Native performance and security |
| SSH | russh | SSH protocol implementation |
| Terminal | xterm.js | Terminal emulation |
| Recording | asciinema-player | Session playback |
| Database | SQLite, MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB | Local and sync storage |
| Encryption | AES-256-GCM + Argon2 | Data encryption and key derivation |

### Code Quality

```bash
# Format code
npm run pretty

# Type checking
npm run build

# Full development build
npm run tauri dev
```

### Design Patterns

- **Dependency Injection**: Backend services use Arc<Mutex<T>> pattern
- **Service Layer**: Clean separation between UI, business logic, and data access
- **State Management**: Centralized Pinia stores with computed properties
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive try/catch with user-friendly messages

## 📊 Performance

- **Efficient Buffer Management**: Circular buffer for terminal history with memory limits
- **Connection Pooling**: Reuse SSH connections for better performance
- **Lazy Loading**: Components and data loaded on demand
- **Optimized Rendering**: WebGL-accelerated terminal with efficient updates
- **Background Processing**: Async operations don't block UI

## 🔒 Security Considerations

- All sensitive data encrypted at rest with AES-256-GCM
- Master password never stored, only verification hash
- Device-specific encryption keys prevent data access from other devices
- SSH private keys never leave the device unencrypted
- Sync data encrypted before transmission
- Automatic session locking after inactivity
- Platform keychain integration for secure auto-unlock

## 🤝 Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Please follow these guidelines:

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add amazing feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/amazing-feature`)
5. Open a Pull Request

### Development Guidelines

- Follow the existing code style and patterns
- Use TypeScript for frontend code
- Write clear, self-documenting code
- Test SSH connections and sync functionality
- Follow SOLID principles
- Keep components focused and reusable

## ❗ Known Issues

- Limited support for some SSH authentication methods
- MacOS version is **not signed/notarized yet** due to Apple Developer Program restrictions (it takes **99 USD/year!**) So please build from source if you want to use on MacOS or run unsigned app with `xattr -rd com.apple.quarantine /path/to/Kerminal.app` after first launch.
- Android version is currently not working (some how it works on my device (Xiaomi Redmi Note 12) but not on other devices).
